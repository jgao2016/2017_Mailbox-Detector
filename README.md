# 2017_Mailbox-Detector

Team members: Jingchen Gao, Donghai Liu.

This installation can detect new mails in the mailbox of coworking space and send notifications accordingly.
The program uses the difference between current pixel colors and the pixel colors of a "baseline" image to determine if new mails have arrived.
The change of environmental light and human interference are excluded. 
A projector is also used to highlight the boxes with new mails to attract attention.
